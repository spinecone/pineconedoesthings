I had so much fun figuring out how to put links, music, and pretty colors on my website, I hardly realized I was learning. Years later, I realized, to my horror, that most people did not learn to program by having fun. They were expected to make things that other people had decided were important. Some didn't even know that programming could be fun.
				       <p>
				       I create workshops to not only teach people how to program, but to show them that they deserve to learn in a way that is enjoyable and personally meaningful for them.

				       If you're interested in presenting any of my workshops at a meetup or conference, I'm so glad! You're helping bring more delightful, weird software into the world! I just ask that you 1) <a href="https://twitter.com/spine_cone">let me know</a> 2) attribute me somewhere in your presentation 3) not receive any financial compensation for the workshop.
